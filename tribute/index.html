            <h3>Operation Black Tornado : Nov 2008 </h3>
            <p>
                On the night of 26 November 2008, several iconic buildings in South Mumbai were attacked. One of the
                buildings where hostages were held was the 100-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Major Unnikrishnan was
                the team commander of 51 Special Action Group (51 SAG) deployed in the operation at the hotel to rescue
                the hostages. He entered the hotel with a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the
                staircase. As the team descended the stairs, they suspected perpetrators on the third floor. A few women
                were held as hostages in a room which was locked from the inside.

                The team decided to break open the door and when it was done the team faced barrage of fire from the
                terrorists. The rounds of fire by the perpetrators hit Commando Sunil Yadav, who was Major
                Unnikrishnan’s colleague. Major Unnikrishnan engaged the perpetrators in a firefight and arranged for
                Yadav’s evacuation. Later Major Unnikrishnan gave a chase to the terrorists who had escaped to another
                floor of the hotel. In the encounter that followed, he was shot from the back which proved fatal. His
                last words, according to NSG officials were, “Do not come up, I will handle them” . His exceptional
                courage and leadership motivated his comrades to eliminate all the terrorists and complete the assigned
                mission successfully.
